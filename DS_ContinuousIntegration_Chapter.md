## Continuous Integration

What is continuous integration and why should you care? Continuous integration is the practice of routinely integrating code into the main branch of a repository. Testing of these integrations should be conducted as early as possible and often as possible [^1]. Automated testing is a key feature of conintuous integration. Automated tests with continuous integration help assure that your code is always in a working state. Verification of successfully building code is essential for continuous delivery and deployment to production code. This automated process allows for quick feedback on code and possible bugs. Manually testing and deploying takes significantly more time and by the time the manual testing might be done then more errors or bugs could be discovered allowing a sort of "build up" of problems [^1].\
